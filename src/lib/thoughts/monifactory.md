Recently, my friends and I finished [Monifactory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/monifactory). There's even a [base tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfyTtgJk1RI).

For those not in the know, Monifactory is a Minecraft modpack centered around the GregTech mod. GregTech is a very industrial factory-focused mod that primarily adds a ton of machines for shaping metals, performing chemistry, etching silicon, and much more, which transforms Minecraft into a factory-building resource-management game (think Factorio, Satisfactory, etc.). Quite the nerdy modpack.

Our server mainly consisted of myself and my friend [Stephen](https://steffnstuff.com/), with my roommate Kevin popping in intermittently. We began the playthrough somewhere near the end of December 2025, and finished it half a year later, near the end of June 2025. Though there were some hiatuses, the content length promise of GregTech definitely delivered.

All in all, Monifactory (normal mode) probably falls on the lighter side of the spectrum of gregginess. You play on peaceful difficulty, get relatively early flight, and crucially, fairly early AE2.
