Recently, my friends and I finished [Monifactory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/monifactory). There's even a [base tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfyTtgJk1RI).

As a player of Minecraft since version 1.4, I've had a lot of time to discover the best parts of the game. I have clocked many (more than I care to admit) hours playing on Hypixel, engaging in 2-week Minecraft phases, building redstone contraptions, and much more.

With that in mind, I find that the best Minecraft is modded Minecraft. You would be hard-pressed to find a modding community that's as diverse, capable, and widespread. Minecraft modpacks span an incredible spectrum of genres. My poison of choice? Tech modpacks.

### the pack

For those not in the know, Monifactory is a Minecraft modpack centered around the GregTech mod. GregTech is a very industrial factory-focused mod that primarily adds a ton of machines for shaping metals, performing chemistry, etching silicon, and much more, which transforms Minecraft into a factory-building resource-management game (think Factorio, Satisfactory, etc.). Quite the nerdy modpack.

The essential gameplay loop is that you gather resources to make machines, in the name of creating better circuits to climb through ever higher voltage tiers, to eventually make the _Creative Chest_ (it dispenses unlimited amounts of any item you put into it, thereby completing the game). There are some 12 odd voltage tiers in this rendition of GregTech, each complete with its own new set of materials and processes.

Voltage tier names aren't purely for content organization, either. The electricity consumption of successive tiers grows exponentially. So, in addition to collecting enough resources and building sufficiently robust machine lines, you also have to generate enough power to run it all. These 3 constant strains on your factory constitute the basic

All in all, Monifactory (on normal mode) falls on the lighter side of the spectrum of gregginess. You play on peaceful difficulty, get relatively early flight, and crucially, fairly early AE2. This made the pack much more palatable for those who prefer focusing on the factory aspect of GregTech and not so much the punishing early-game struggle (I'm looking at you, [GTNH](https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/)).

### the playthrough

Our server mainly consisted of myself and my friend [Stephen](https://steffnstuff.com/), with my roommate Kevin popping in intermittently. We began the playthrough somewhere near the end of December 2025, and finished it half a year later, near the end of June 2025. Though there were some hiatuses, the content length promise of GregTech definitely delivered.
